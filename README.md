### 🚀 Current Projects

1. **TaskList App** - A task management app using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, with functionalities like creating, editing, and deleting tasks. It's a personal project to get better at managing state in Android apps.

2. **Recetario de Cocina** - A cooking recipe app where users can explore recipes, save their favorites, and share their own. The app will feature a calendar for meal planning and region-based recipes. I'm still working on the MVP, focusing on authentication and displaying recipes from an API.

3. **Portfolio Website** - A personal website built with Astro and TailwindCSS, showcasing my projects and web development skills. I'm currently adding a dynamic tab feature to display different project categories.
